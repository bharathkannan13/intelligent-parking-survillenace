# NewANPRPY

## Project Overview
NewANPRPY is a project focused on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Python. The system is designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or video streams, providing a foundation for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and law enforcement.

## Features
- **License Plate Detection**: Identify and extract license plates from images or video frames.
- **Character Recognition**: Recognize alphanumeric characters on the detected license plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques for reliable results.
- **Scalability**: Can be integrated into larger systems for real-time processing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NewANPRPY.git
    cd NewANPRPY
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Provide an image or video file as input.
3. View the detected license plates and recognized characters in the output.
